## Guidelines

Please make sure that:

- Code follows the existing style and structure  
- New features are kept lightweight and dependency-free where possible  
- API usage remains respectful (rate limiting + caching preserved)  
- Any user-facing changes are documented if needed  

If you’re unsure about a change, feel free to open a Pull Request anyway, discussion is welcome.
