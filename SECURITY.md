## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security-related problems.**

Instead:

1. Open a private security advisory on GitHub (preferred), or  
2. Contact the maintainer directly.

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Potential impact  
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or PoC code

You can expect:

- An acknowledgement within a few days  
- A best-effort fix for supported versions  
- Responsible disclosure once the issue is resolved

---

## Scope

This policy covers:

- The Stationbord application code  
- API usage and request handling  
- Docker images (if used)  
- Configuration and environment variable handling

It does **not** cover:

- Issues in third-party services (such as the iRail API itself)  
- Problems caused by misconfigured self-hosted environments

## Thanks

Responsible disclosure helps keep the project safe for everyone.  
Your effort is appreciated.
